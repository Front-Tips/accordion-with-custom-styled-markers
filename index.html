            <div class="faq__content">
              Setting up your FarmBot involves assembling
              the frame, attaching the motors and tracks,
              and installing the electronics. Ensure all
              components are securely fastened. Connect the
              FarmBot to your garden's water supply and to a
              power source. Finally, configure the FarmBot
              using the provided software, setting up the
              plant layout and scheduling.

              Programming FarmBot for optimal Plant Growth

            <div class="faq__content">
              <p>
                Program your FarmBot by using the web
                application to create sequences for
                watering, weeding, and planting. Customize
                these sequences based on the types of plants
                and their specific needs. Regularly update
                the plant growth stages in the app to ensure
                FarmBot adjusts its care routines
                accordingly.
